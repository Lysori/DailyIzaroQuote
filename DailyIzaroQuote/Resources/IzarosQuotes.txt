A potent little gift from our primitive past.
When the time comes to strike, an emperor strikes without hesitation
Pity the emperor who sits alone on his throne
There is a fine line between consideration and hesitation. The former is wisdom, the latter is fear
You there, let me bend your air for a moment
Wisdom is the offspring of Suffering and Time
Sweep the trappings of past Emperors aside. Make your empire anew
The throne is the most devious trap of them all
My three lieutenants remain. Misery loves company, I suppose
Where the weapons remain, a new enemy will simply take the place of the old
To entertain doubt is to dance with death
The Azmeri were the first culture known in history to use trials of strength, wisdom and spirit to select its chieftains
Slowness lends strength to one 's enemies
An empire should sparkle like ice upon the winter stone
The last emperor is always the worst
Complex machinations converge to a single act of power
The Emperor beckons and the world attends
Some things that slumber should never be awoken
Dark influences reside in dark places
The pursuit of power can be a grotesque affair
A locked door merely encourages curiosity
There is nothing quite so enticing as a locked door
Argus does enjoy new playthings
Any mystery can be unlocked, if one has the right key
Let the day dawn golden with possibility
Gold is the most liberating of metals
Where there's a silver key there must be a silver door
An emperor must know precisely where he stands
An emperor must bear two blades. Hope in the left hand. Surety in the right
Where there's a golden key there must be a golden door
Allow your wisdom to be tempered by the flames of the past.
